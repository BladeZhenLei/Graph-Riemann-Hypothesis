The famous Riemann hypothesis is closely related to the distribution of primes. In graph theory, by defining prime paths, a graph is said to be Ramanujan if and only if its Ihara zeta function satisfies an analogy of the Riemann hypothesis. This concept was origionally introduced by Toshikazu Sunada in 1985 and developed by A.A.Terras and H.M. Stark.

###  Prime Paths
For a connected, finite graph $X$, its edges can be labeled as $(e_1,e_2,...,e_m)$, $e_{m+1}=e_1^{-1}$ and $e_{2m}=e_m^{-1}$, where $m=|E(X)|$ is the non-oriented edeges, and $e_j^{-1}=e_{j+m}$ denote opposite orientation. Then, we can define paths $C=(a_1,a_2,...,a_n)$, where $a_i$ is an oriented edge of $X$, there exist a $backtracking$ if $a_{i+1}=a_i^{-1}$, the path is said to have a $tail$ if $a_{n}=a_1^{-1}$. The path $C$ is a $closed$ $path$ or a $cycle$ when it consists of vertices $(v_1,v_2,...,v_m=v_1)$, and the closed path is $primitive$ if it has no tail or backtracking and $C\neq{D^f}$ for $f>1$, meaning the path is only allowed once.
