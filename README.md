The famous Riemann hypothesis is closely related to the distribution of primes. In graph theory, by defining prime paths, a graph is said to be Ramanujan if and only if its Ihara zeta function satisfies an analogy of the Riemann hypothesis. This concept was origionally introduced by Toshikazu Sunada in 1985 and developed by A.A.Terras and H.M. Stark.
